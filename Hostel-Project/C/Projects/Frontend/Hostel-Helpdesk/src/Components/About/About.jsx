      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <b>Hostel-HelpDesk</b> — a dedicated platform designed to make it easy 
        for students to report and track issues they face in their hostel or campus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it’s related to <b>electricity, plumbing, furniture, or cleanliness</b>, 
        you can submit your complaint online, and it will be forwarded to the concerned department for a quick resolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to ensure that every student’s concern is heard and resolved 
        efficiently, creating a more comfortable and responsive campus environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that technology can bridge the gap between students and administration — 
        making campus life smoother, safer, and more connected.
      </p>
